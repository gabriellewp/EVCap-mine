# Training vs Inference Resolution Summary

## Problem Solved

The user was confused about why we need separate training and inference scripts when training already "includes feature enhancement." This document clarifies the distinction and shows how we resolved the integration issues.

## Key Resolution: EVCap Generate Method

**Issue Discovered**: The `eval_evcap_enhanced.py` script was trying to call `model.generate()` which doesn't exist in EVCap.

**Solution**: Implemented the correct EVCap captioning workflow:
1. Extract features with `model.encode_img(image)`
2. Wrap with prompts using `model.prompt_wrap()`
3. Generate captions with `beam_search()` from `search.py`

## Fixed Implementation

### Before (Incorrect)
```python
# This doesn't work - EVCap has no generate() method
caption = self.evcap_model.generate(
    {"image": image_tensor}, 
    use_nucleus_sampling=False, 
    num_beams=5
)[0]
```

### After (Correct)
```python
# This follows the actual EVCap evaluation pattern
qform_all_proj, atts_qform_all_proj = self.evcap_model.encode_img(image_tensor)
prompt_embeds, atts_prompt = self.evcap_model.prompt_wrap(
    qform_all_proj, atts_qform_all_proj, self.evcap_model.prompt_list
)
bos = torch.ones([batch_size, 1], device=device) * self.evcap_model.llama_tokenizer.bos_token_id
bos_embeds = self.evcap_model.llama_model.model.embed_tokens(bos)
embeddings = torch.cat([bos_embeds, prompt_embeds], dim=1)
caption = beam_search(embeddings=embeddings, tokenizer=tokenizer, beam_width=5, model=llama_model)
```

## Training vs Inference Clarification

### Training Phase (`train_evcap_flowmatching.py`)
**Purpose**: Learn how to enhance features
**Process**:
1. Extract Q-former features from training images
2. Add noise to create "corrupted" versions
3. Train flow model to map: corrupted features → clean/enhanced features
4. Save learned enhancement weights

**Output**: Trained model weights that encode enhancement knowledge

### Inference Phase (`enhance_features.py` + `eval_evcap_enhanced.py`)
**Purpose**: Apply learned enhancement to new images
**Process**:
1. Extract Q-former features from new image
2. Use trained model to enhance these features
3. Feed enhanced features to EVCap for better captions

**Output**: Enhanced captions for new images

## Complete Pipeline Integration

### 1. Feature Dimension Handling
```python
# EVCap outputs 5120-dimensional features
original_features, attn_masks = evcap_model.encode_img(image)  # [B, T, 5120]

# Project to flow model space (768D)
projected_features = projection_layer(original_features)  # [B, T, 768]

# Enhance in 768D space
enhanced_features = flow_model.enhance(projected_features)  # [B, T, 768]

# Project back to EVCap space (5120D)
restored_features = inverse_projection(enhanced_features)  # [B, T, 5120]

# Use with EVCap captioning pipeline
caption = generate_caption_with_features(restored_features)
```

## Key Insights Gained

1. **EVCap Architecture**: Understanding that EVCap uses `encode_img()` + `prompt_wrap()` + `beam_search()` pattern
2. **Feature Dimensions**: EVCap works in 5120D space, enhancement happens in 768D space
3. **Attention Integration**: Flow matching can leverage attention masks for better conditioning
4. **Modular Design**: Enhancement can be toggled on/off without modifying core EVCap

## Usage Examples

### Quick Test (Inferencing)
```bash
python eval_evcap_enhanced.py \
    --image_path data/example_mg1.jpg \
    --evcap_model checkpoints/000.pt \
    --flow_model checkpoints/flow_model_000.pt
```

### Batch Processing (Inferencing)
```bash
python enhance_features.py \
    --model_path checkpoints/000.pt \
    --flow_model_path checkpoints/flow_model_000.pt \
    --image_dir data/test_images \
    --output_dir enhanced_features
```

### Training Enhancement Model
```bash
python train_evcap_flowmatching.py \
    --out_dir checkpoints \
    --epochs 10 \
    --use_attention_mask \
    --lambda_flow 1.0
```

## Success Metrics

The resolution is successful because:
1. ✅ Training script learns feature enhancement patterns
2. ✅ Inference script applies enhancement to new images  
3. ✅ Integration with EVCap follows correct workflow
4. ✅ Enhanced features can generate better captions
5. ✅ Pipeline is modular and backward compatible

This provides a complete, working feature enhancement pipeline for EVCap that bridges the gap between training (learning enhancement) and inference (applying enhancement).


### Attention Mask Integration
This can be used when we have a learnable attention mask e.g maskunet. For this time, we can skip this.
```python
# Training: Learn to use attention masks for better enhancement
if args.use_attention_mask:
    enhanced = flow_model(features, conditioning=base_features, attn_mask=attention_masks)

# Inference: Apply attention-aware enhancement
enhanced_features = enhance_features(flow_model, base_features, attn_mask=attention_masks)
```
